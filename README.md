**These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but these are mine.**

**My dotfiles are best friend. It is my life. I must master them  as I must master my life.**

# Goals
* I use vim in terminal mode.
* I try to use standard Vim tools and avoid plugins (netrw vs NerdTree)
* While I started with Janus for VIM, I've now stripped down to the basics

# Tools
* I use ack instead of grep
